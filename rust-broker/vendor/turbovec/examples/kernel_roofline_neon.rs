//! The aarch64 counterpart to `kernel_roofline`: what rate can this machine
//! sustain on the NEON kernel's inner pattern, and how close is the real
//! kernel?
//!
//! P8 measured the AVX-512 kernel at 79% of its achievable issue rate, and
//! found that the *paper* port figure (1 shuffle/cycle) was not the ceiling —
//! the surrounding loads and adds were. Deriving arm's headroom from the same
//! kind of paper number (NEON 2 `tbl`/cycle) would repeat exactly that
//! mistake, so measure it instead.
//!
//! Mirrors `score_4query_block_neon`: load 32 B of codes for one block-group,
//! split nibbles once, then per query load the two 16-byte sub-tables, do
//! four `vqtbl1q_u8` lookups, and widen-accumulate into u16.
//!

/// A paired layout that makes `vpadalq_u8` (UADALP) the accumulate step.
///
/// The accumulate chain is the critical path here — P9 found the loop bound
/// by its ANDs, adds and accumulator pressure rather than by the lookup
/// unit, and Faiss's NEON kernel spends 4 ops per 16 lanes on it where ours
/// spends 3 (`vaddq_u8` + two `vaddw_u8`). `UADALP` would spend 1: it adds
/// adjacent byte lanes pairwise and accumulates straight into u16.
///
/// It is semantically wrong under the current layout, where adjacent byte
/// lanes are different database vectors — folding them sums two vectors'
/// scores together. It becomes exactly right under a layout where byte lane
/// 2i and lane 2i+1 hold vector i's codes for two *consecutive byte-groups*,
/// because then the pairwise fold is summing two dimensions of one vector,
/// which is precisely what the score wants. That is the same manoeuvre the
/// x86 kernel already makes for `vpdpbusd`.
///
/// The obstacle is that the two lanes now need two different 16-entry LUTs,
/// and `vqtbl1q_u8` has one table for the whole register. `vqtbl2q_u8`
/// solves it: a 32-entry table holding both groups' LUTs, indexed by
/// `(parity << 4) | code`. The V2 optimisation guide prices ASIMD TBL with
/// "1 or 2 table" registers identically — latency 2, throughput 2, V01 — so
/// the wider table costs nothing.
///
/// Accounting per 32 bytes of codes, per query: the current shape spends
/// 4 TBL + 2 `vaddq_u8` + 4 `vaddw_u8` = 10 ops to cover 32 vectors x 1
/// group. This shape spends 4 TBL2 + 2 `vaddq_u8` + 2 `vpadalq_u8` = 8 ops
/// to cover 16 vectors x 2 groups — the same total work for 20% fewer
/// per-query ops. The shared nibble split costs 2 extra `ORR` to fold the
/// parity bit into the indices, amortised across the four queries, putting
/// the whole unit at 38 ops against 44.
///
/// This measures the instruction mix only. The layout it assumes is a real
/// change to the packed format, so it is priced here before any of that
/// work is started — the same order the x86 change was taken in.
