//! Deterministic orthogonal rotation via a globally-permuted
//! block-Hadamard transform.
//!
//! The rotation decorrelates coordinates so that each coordinate of a
//! unit vector follows the near-Gaussian marginal the Lloyd-Max codebook
//! is fit against. Unlike the dense QR-of-a-Gaussian rotation it replaces
//! (turbovec ≤ 0.9.0), this transform is **deterministic bit-for-bit**
//! across platforms, CPU architectures, and thread counts:
//!
//! * There is no matrix and no GEMM — the transform is applied in place
//!   to each row as sign flips, in-block Walsh-Hadamard butterflies, and
//!   integer permutations. Every arithmetic op is a plain `+`, `-`, or a
//!   single `*` by a fixed constant; the reduction (add) order is fixed
//!   and no fused-multiply-add is used, so a SIMD implementation would be
//!   obligated to match the scalar result exactly.
//! * The sign flips and permutations are drawn from ChaCha8, whose byte
//!   stream is a pure function of the seed — identical on every target.
//!
//! This closes issue #206: the old QR rotation read the global rayon
//! parallelism and used `faer`'s order-dependent parallel Householder
//! reduction plus a transcendental Ziggurat sampler, so its output
//! changed with `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` (dim ≥ 1536) and between libm
//! implementations (dim ≥ 3072). It also dispatched the rotate GEMM to a
//! per-OS BLAS backend, so the *encoded bytes* differed by platform. The
//! block-Hadamard transform removes all three causes by construction and
//! drops the 42 MB OpenBLAS dependency.
//!
//! # The transform (frozen wire-format invariant)
//!
//! Let `B` be the largest power-of-two divisor of `dim` (always ≥ 8,
//! since `dim` is a positive multiple of 8). One *round* is, in order:
//!
//! 1. a **global** ChaCha8-seeded Fisher-Yates permutation across all
//!    `dim` coordinates,
//! 2. a ChaCha8-seeded ±1 sign flip of every coordinate, and
//! 3. a normalized Walsh-Hadamard transform (× `1/√B`) applied
//!    independently to each contiguous `B`-coordinate block.
//!
//! The rotation is [`K`] = 2 rounds.
//!
//! **The permutation comes first, before every Hadamard.** This makes the
//! transform *order-invariant*: a `B`-block is never formed from
//! contiguous input coordinates. Importance-ordered embeddings —
//! matryoshka/MRL (e.g. OpenAI text-embedding-3, Nomic) and PCA-projected
//! vectors, whose energy decays monotonically with coordinate index — put
//! similar-energy coordinates next to each other, so a block built from
//! contiguous coordinates would group highly-correlated coordinates that
//! the small Walsh-Hadamard cannot decorrelate. At weak-block dims (`B =
//! 8`, i.e. `8·odd`) this measurably regressed recall versus the QR
//! rotation until the leading permutation was added; it scatters those
//! coordinates across blocks so the result no longer depends on the input
//! coordinate ordering. The global permutation between rounds also makes
//! two rounds mix across block boundaries — a single round leaves the
//! blocks independent and regresses recall; two rounds are statistically
//! indistinguishable from the old QR rotation's recall.
//!
//! Each of permutation, sign flip, and normalized Hadamard is orthogonal,
//! so their composition is orthogonal: the transform preserves L2 norm
//! (to f32 rounding) and its inverse is its transpose.
