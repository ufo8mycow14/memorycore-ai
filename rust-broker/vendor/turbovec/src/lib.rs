//! TurboQuant implementation for vector search.
//!
//! Compresses high-dimensional vectors to 2-4 bits per coordinate with
//! near-optimal distortion. Data-oblivious — no training required.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use turbovec::TurboQuantIndex;
//!
//! // 1536-dim vectors compressed to 4 bits per coordinate.
//! let mut index = TurboQuantIndex::new(1536, 4).unwrap();
//!
//! // `vectors` is a flat [f32] of length n * dim, `queries` likewise.
//! let vectors: Vec<f32> = vec![0.0; 1536 * 10];
//! let queries: Vec<f32> = vec![0.0; 1536 * 2];
//!
//! index.add(&vectors);
//! let results = index.search(&queries, 10);
//! index.write("index.tv").unwrap();
//! let loaded = TurboQuantIndex::load("index.tv").unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # Concurrent search
//!
//! `search` takes `&self` and is safe to call from multiple threads
//! concurrently. Internally the rotation, the Lloyd-Max centroids
//! and the SIMD-blocked code layout are initialised lazily via
//! [`std::sync::OnceLock`], so the first caller pays the one-time
//! initialisation cost and every subsequent caller reads the caches
//! without locking. [`TurboQuantIndex::prepare`] can be called once
//! after `add`/`load` to pay that cost up front.
//!
//! Mutation still flows through `&mut self`, and the invariant it keeps
//! is stated in terms of what a reader can observe rather than in terms
//! of what any one mutator does: **whenever the index is reachable
//! through `&self`, every populated cache describes exactly the
//! `len()` rows the index currently holds.**
//!
//! That holds by construction. The rotation, boundaries and centroids
//! are pure functions of `dim` and `bit_width`, neither of which ever
//! changes after the first add, so they can never go stale. The blocked
//! layout and the packed bit-plane rows are two encodings of the same
//! rows, each derivable from the other; a mutation holds `&mut self` for
//! its whole duration, so no concurrent reader exists while one of them
//! is being brought up to date, and by the time that borrow ends both
//! the row count and every populated cache describe the same rows.
//!
//! Which of the two encodings a mutation updates is an implementation
//! detail that has changed more than once and is deliberately not
//! promised here. A [`TurboQuantIndex::load`]ed index may hold only the
//! blocked form until something needs the packed rows
//! ([`TurboQuantIndex::packed_ready`] reports which); elsewhere the
//! packed rows lead. Both give bit-identical search results.

// turbovec is 64-bit by design: the SIMD kernels, the `usize` size/offset
// arithmetic in `encode`/`pack`/`search`, and all benchmarks assume a 64-bit
// pointer width. On a 32-bit (or 16-bit) target those size computations could
// overflow `usize` and index out of bounds. Refuse to compile there rather
// than ship a silently-unsafe build — supporting 32-bit/wasm would require a
// dedicated checked-arithmetic pass first.
