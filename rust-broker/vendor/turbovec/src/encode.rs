//! Encode vectors: normalize, rotate, calibrate, quantize, bit-pack, scale.
//!
//! For each vector `v` with rotated unit form `u` and reconstructed
//! centroid vector `x_hat`, the stored scale is `||v|| / <u, x_hat>` —
//! the RaBitQ-style length-renormalization correction adapted to
//! turbovec's Lloyd-Max codebook. Applying this scale at the final
//! score-multiplication site in the SIMD kernel gives an unbiased
//! estimator of `<v, q>`.
//!
//! # TQ+ per-coordinate calibration
//!
//! After random rotation, each coord *should* follow the canonical
//! Beta((d-1)/2, (d-1)/2) marginal that Lloyd-Max was fit against. In
//! practice, anisotropic data leaves residual deviation per coord, and
//! the shared codebook then mis-fits. TQ+ corrects this with two free
//! parameters per coord — a `shift` and a `scale` — chosen to map that
//! coord's empirical quantiles onto the codebook's outermost centroids.
//! The probability level is taken from the codebook itself (see
//! [`tqplus_anchor`]) rather than fixed, because the level the outermost
//! centroid sits at moves with bit width:
//!
//! ```text
//! u_calibrated[d] = (u_rot[d] + shift[d]) * scale_tq[d]
//! ```
//!
//! Quantization runs on `u_calibrated`; the search path applies the
//! inverse on the query side (`q_calib[d] = q_rot[d] / scale_tq[d]`)
//! plus a per-query bias correction `-<q_rot, shift>`. Net effect:
//! same kernel, same code, better-matched codebook.
