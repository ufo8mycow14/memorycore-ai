// Scores a block of 32 vectors against 4 queries using `vpermb` for the table
// lookup and `vpdpbusd` for the accumulation, over codes in the vector-major
// layout (see `pack::vector_major_chunk`).
//
// Why a dot-product instruction is legal here at all: in the classic layout
// adjacent code bytes belong to different database vectors, so `vpdpbusd`'s
// 4-byte reduction would mix them. Vector-major puts one vector's codes for
// four consecutive byte-groups in each aligned 4-byte group, so the reduction
// sums four byte-groups *for that vector* and lands in that vector's dword
// lane. `vpermb`'s 6-bit index then lets byte position `j` select a different
// 16-entry sub-table from a 64-byte concatenation — which `vpshufb` cannot do,
// since it applies one 16-byte table per 128-bit lane.
//
// Two consequences beyond the op count: accumulation is u32, so there is no
// u16 overflow and hence no periodic f32 flush (the score rounds once at the
// end rather than every FLUSH_EVERY groups — more accurate, but NOT
// bit-identical to the classic kernel); and one accumulator per 16 vectors
// per query replaces the classic kernel's 16 live zmm.
//
// Measured x1.52 on the inner sequence and x1.388 over a full 73 MB scan; see

/// The depth-8 lookahead is worth +16% at nq=1 ST and costs ~5% at nq=100,
/// because a 2-bit block is half a 4-bit block: H62's distance runs two
/// thirds of a block ahead here and evicts what the next pass re-reads. A

        // (H135). The wider batch pays for itself only through the pass it
        // removes: a batch scores all its lanes and reports only the queries
        // that exist, so where both widths need the same number of passes the
        // wider one just pads more lanes. H135 measured that directly —
