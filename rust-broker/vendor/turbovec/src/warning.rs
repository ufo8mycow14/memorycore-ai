//! Non-fatal diagnostics: conditions a caller must be able to see but
//! that are not failures of the operation that produced them.
//!
//! There is exactly one today — the post-commit durability shortfall in
//! [`io`](crate::io) (#365): the rename that publishes a saved index has
//! already succeeded, so the save is not an error, but the caller is
//! entitled to know that the rename may not survive power loss.
//!
//! A library must not decide unilaterally that stderr is the right place
//! for that. A service that captures its logs structurally never sees a
//! bare `eprintln!`, and a caller who does not want the line has no way
//! to turn it off. So the sink is a process-global hook the embedder
//! installs — the shape `std::panic::set_hook` uses for the same problem
//! — with a stderr default so that doing nothing still shows the
//! warning rather than dropping it.
//!
//! Why not the `log`/`tracing` facade: turbovec has no logging
//! dependency today, and a facade with no logger installed *discards*
//! the record silently, which is the one outcome #365 rules out. A hook
//! forwards into whichever facade the embedder actually uses in three
//! lines, and costs downstreams nothing.
//!
//! The slot is a single [`AtomicPtr`], not a `Mutex`/`OnceLock`: reading
//! it is one atomic load that can never block, so a warning emitted in
//! a process that has forked behaves the same as in one that has not
//! (see [`codebook`](crate::codebook) for the same requirement stated at
//! length). It is also replaceable, which set-once cells are not.
