//! The shared write protocol behind TurboVec index files.
//!
//! Index bytes themselves are v7 and live in `io_v7`; every entry point
//! is a method on the index types ([`crate::TurboQuantIndex::write`],
//! `to_bytes`, `write_to_writer` and their `IdMapIndex` counterparts).
//! What remains here is what those share: the atomic-replace protocol,
//! the stale-temp sweep, [`Durability`], and the value-level bounds a
//! load enforces on a calibration.
//!
//! Older files (v5, v6) are refused: the release that wrote them can
//! still read them, so re-saving there is the migration route, and
//! anything older than v5 has to be rebuilt from the source vectors.
//!
//! ## Atomic-write protocol
//!
//! Path-based writes go to a sibling temp file named
//! `<dest>.tmp.{pid}.{seq}.{rand}` — pid plus a process-wide counter
//! plus a random component — opened with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`, so a
//! pre-existing file or planted symlink at the temp name is refused
//! rather than followed, then atomically renamed over the destination.
//! A write killed between temp creation and rename (SIGKILL, power
//! loss) can leave the temp behind; the next save to the same
//! destination sweeps siblings matching this exact pattern whose mtime
//! is over an hour old. Note that if the destination itself is a
//! symlink, the rename replaces the *link* with a regular file (the
//! link's target is left untouched) — standard atomic-replace
//! semantics.
//!
//! ## What this module no longer does
//!
//! `.tv` and `.tvim` used to be described here, at version 6, with a
//! loader that also accepted v5. Both formats now live in `io_v7` and
//! carry the v7 container; the readers and writers for the older two
//! are gone, along with the raw module-level entry points that drove
//! them.
//!
//! [`legacy_format_error`] is what remains of that history. It names a
//! file it cannot read rather than guessing: a v5 or v6 index converts
//! forward with [`crate::convert`], while versions 1 through 4 predate
//! the v5 rotation change — which altered every encoded byte — and can
//! only be rebuilt from the source vectors.
//!
//! One case it cannot name: a version 1 `.tv` began with a bare
//! `bit_width` byte and carries no magic at all, so it is indistinguishable
//! from any other non-turbovec file and is reported as such.
