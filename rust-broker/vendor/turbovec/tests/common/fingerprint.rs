//! The encode fingerprint: one six-column hash row per `(dim, bits)` cell.
//!
//! This module is the single definition of the fingerprint, shared by its
//! two consumers so they can never drift apart:
//!
//! * `examples/encode_hash.rs` prints the rows. CI runs it on Linux,
//!   macOS and Windows and fails unless the three agree — that leg
//!   catches *platform-specific* divergence.
//! * `tests/encode_fingerprint.rs` compares the rows against frozen
//!   constants. That catches drift which moves every platform *together*
//!   — a `statrs` bump, a libm change, a retuned reduction order — which
//!   the cross-OS leg is structurally blind to (#346, #352).
//!
//! Both halves are needed and neither subsumes the other. Keeping the
//! fixture here rather than duplicating it means "the golden test pins
//! what the example prints" is enforced by the compiler instead of by a
//! comment.
//!
//! It lives under `tests/common/` (a subdirectory, so cargo does not
//! treat it as a test target of its own) and the example reaches it with
//! a `#[path]` module.

// The two consumers use different subsets: the example only formats
// rows, the golden test only reads columns. Neither is dead code from
// the crate's point of view, but each compilation unit sees the other's
// half as unused.
