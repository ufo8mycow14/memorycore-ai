//! Golden pin for the Lloyd-Max codebook.
//!
//! The codebook is baked into every encoded vector: `boundaries` decides
//! each coordinate's code and `centroids` sets the reconstruction the
//! stored per-vector scale is computed against. It is *not* a frozen
//! table — it is recomputed at runtime from `statrs`'s Beta cdf/pdf,
//! which bottom out in `ln`/`exp`.
//!
//! Two different things can move it, and they need two different
//! defences:
//!
//! * **Across platforms**, for one build — different libms, different
//!   rounding. That is what the cross-OS fingerprint CI leg checks, and
//!   `codebook::lloyd_max` now derives boundaries from the already-
//!   rounded f32 centroids so the fragile step is gone.
//! * **Across builds**, on one platform — a `statrs` release that
//!   changes its special functions by an ulp, or a libm update. The
//!   fingerprint leg cannot see this: it compares three OSes *within a
//!   single locked build*, so a drift that moves every platform together
//!   passes it silently. Both inputs that can move this way are
//!   exact-pinned for the same reason — `rand_chacha` at `=0.3.1`
//!   because the rotation's byte stream is format-frozen, `statrs` at
//!   `=0.17.1` because the codebook and the TQ+ calibration are (#346).
//!   A pin is not a guard, though: it fixes the version, not the
//!   values, so it does nothing about a libm update, and it is one
//!   manifest line that a deliberate bump or a dependency sweep can
//!   raise. This test is what makes any of those fail loudly for the
//!   codebook.
//!
//! The constants below are not local observations — they are the values
//! Linux, macOS and Windows independently agreed on in the
//! `Encode fingerprint` CI legs, cross-checked against
//! `examples/encode_hash`, which uses this same hash over these same
//! cells.
//!
//! If this test fails, encoded bytes have moved for identical input.
//! That is a format change, not a rounding nit: decide it deliberately
//! and re-freeze, don't paper over it.
