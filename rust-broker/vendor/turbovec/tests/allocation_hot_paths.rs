//! Allocation-shape gates for the two hot paths in issue #409.
//!
//! These pin a *decision* — how many heap allocations a code path makes,
//! and whether that number scales with the number of vectors — not a
//! duration. A wall-clock ratio would be flaky on shared CI runners and
//! slow enough to threaten the mutation gate; an allocation count is
//! exact and costs microseconds.
//!
//! Counting is per-thread and opt-in, so these tests stay correct when
//! the harness runs them in parallel with each other and with the rest
//! of the suite: only the thread inside [`count_allocs`] is counted, and
//! every path measured here is serial on the calling thread.
